**pandoc** R package is an experimental package aiming first to help
maintainers of R Markdown ecosystem.

The R Markdown ecosystem is highly dependent on Pandoc
<https://pandoc.org/> and aims to be as version independent as possible.
R Markdown is best used with the latest Pandoc version but any rmarkdown
package version should work with previous version, and new change in
Pandoc should not break any rmarkdown features.

This explain the needs to some more focused tooling to:

-   Install and manage several pandoc versions. This is useful for
    testing versions and comparing between them.
-   Call pandoc directly without the layers added by **rmarkdown**. This
    is useful for debugging or quickly iterating and finding where a bug
    could be.
-   Retreive information from Pandoc directly. Each version comes with
    changes and some of them are included into the binary. Being able to
    retrieve those information and compare between version is also
    important to help maintain the user exposed tooling.
