## Resubmission

This is a resubmission. Following review process feedback, in this version I have:

* Removed `if(FALSE)` usage in examples that had it, by reorganizing for simplification and using proper `if()` statements that correctly allow users to run examples.

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 note

* This is a new release.
